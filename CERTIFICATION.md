# NetBox Plugin Certification Evidence

This checklist tracks readiness for the NetBox Plugin Certification Program.

| Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Open source license | Apache-2.0 in `LICENSE` and `pyproject.toml` |
| Package metadata | PyPI project `netbox-proxbox`, project URLs, classifiers, Python `>=3.12` |
| NetBox compatibility | Plugin config supports backward-compatible `4.5.8` through `4.7.0`, including official `v4.7.0` GA |
| Dependency policy | `proxbox-api` is deployed separately; the plugin communicates with it over REST, SSE, and WebSocket |
| CI | GitHub Actions run lint, typecheck, compile, pytest, E2E Docker, page coverage, screenshots, docs, and release validation |
| Documentation | README, MkDocs site, installation, backend setup, configuration, user guide, API, release notes, and support links |
| Screenshots | Committed screenshots live in `docs/assets/screenshots`; `docs-screenshots.yml` refreshes them against NetBox v4.7.0 |
| Icon | NetBox menu uses Material Design Icons class `mdi mdi-dns` |
| Maintainer access | Repositories stay under `emersonfelipesp`; NetBox Labs staff can be invited as collaborators when requested |
