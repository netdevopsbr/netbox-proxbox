# Recovering / Regenerating Proxbox Data

Use this guide when a NetBox upgrade, plugin reinstall, or failed bootstrap leaves
Proxbox setup data incomplete. A common symptom is that legacy Proxbox custom
fields are missing, so old synced records no longer show the expected Proxmox
metadata.

## Where To Find The Card

The **Repair / Rebuild Proxbox sync-state** card lives on its own page at
`/plugins/proxbox/sync-state/`. Because it is an operator recovery action rather
than a routine one, the page is deliberately **not** listed in the Proxbox
navigation menu: the only entry point is the **Repair / Rebuild sync-state**
link in the footer of `Plugins > Proxbox > Home`.

On that page the card is always visible. What it shows still depends on your
permissions:

- With `view` on `FastAPIEndpoint`, the page checks
  `GET /extras/bootstrap-status` on load and renders the result — the backend
  status badge, any reported detail, and the raw payload. A real bootstrap
  problem is an HTTP 200 response with `ok:false`, e.g. the `Invalid v1 token`
  warnings. If the payload has `skipped:true` and
  `reason:no_netbox_session`, proxbox-api has no **backend-owned** NetBox
  endpoint configured. The status card now says where to configure it instead
  of reporting an unexpected response; add the endpoint in the proxbox-api
  admin UI, then check status again.
- If you can run the repair but cannot view status (`core.add_job` without
  `view` on `FastAPIEndpoint`), the repair button is still available and no
  bootstrap payload is displayed.

## What The Repair Action Does

When you click **Repair / Rebuild**, the plugin:

1. Calls proxbox-api `POST /extras/custom-fields/reconcile` to recreate or
   update the Proxbox custom-field definitions. This is a **best-effort first
   step, not a gate** (see below).
2. Queues a normal NetBox background job using `ProxboxSyncJob.enqueue`.
3. Runs a full Proxbox sync through the existing sync pipeline. The sync's
   preflight re-pushes the NetBox and Proxmox endpoint credentials to
   proxbox-api and rebuilds the typed sync-state sidecars from live Proxmox
   data — this is the step that recovers a stale/invalid backend credential.

The repair action does not create a separate sync path and does not mutate
Proxmox. It uses the same read-side reflection sync as the regular **Full
Update Sync** button.

## Bootstrap Status

The same UI card displays proxbox-api `GET /extras/bootstrap-status`. Use this
payload to see whether proxbox-api thinks custom fields, content types, endpoint
setup, or other bootstrap pieces are missing.

Permissions:

- Viewing bootstrap status requires `view` permission on `FastAPIEndpoint`.
- Running the repair action requires permission to add NetBox `Job` objects
  (`core.add_job`), the same permission used by Proxbox sync enqueue buttons.

## Recovery Steps

1. Confirm proxbox-api is running and the Proxbox **FastAPI Endpoint** row is
   enabled.
2. Open `Plugins > Proxbox > Home` and follow the **Repair / Rebuild
   sync-state** link in the page footer, or go straight to
   `/plugins/proxbox/sync-state/`.
3. Review **Backend bootstrap status**. If it reports missing setup, keep the
   payload available while troubleshooting.
4. Click **Repair / Rebuild**.
5. Open the linked NetBox job from the flash message and wait for it to finish,
   then re-check the bootstrap status.

The custom-field reconcile is **non-fatal**: if proxbox-api rejects it — which is
expected when the backend holds a stale/invalid NetBox credential, since the
reconcile authenticates with that same credential — the plugin records the
reconcile error as a **warning** and still queues the rebuild sync. The queued
sync's preflight re-pushes the endpoint credentials to proxbox-api and rebuilds
sync-state, which is what actually recovers the `Invalid v1 token` state. The
flash message links the job; open it and confirm the sync completed. Only a
failure to *queue* the sync, a missing permission, or an already-running repair
sync is a hard stop. If the reconcile error persists after the sync completes,
verify the NetBox API token configured on the **NetBox Endpoint** row is valid,
then retry.

### Missing backend NetBox endpoint

If the status detail says that the ProxBox backend has no NetBox endpoint
configured, the NetBox plugin's **FastAPI Endpoint** row is not sufficient by
itself. proxbox-api stores its own `NetBoxEndpoint` record because the backend
container makes the NetBox API calls. Configure that record through the
proxbox-api admin UI, confirm the backend can reach NetBox, and use **Check
status** again. A normal sync cannot create this backend connection implicitly.

## Notes On The Sync-State Sidecar Model

The typed `Proxbox*SyncState` sidecar models are the standard source of truth
for the Proxmox↔NetBox linkage. A normal full sync rebuilds sidecars from live
Proxmox data. Migration 0085 removes the VM-only reflection custom fields and
the obsolete `custom_fields_enabled` setting, so recovery of VM identity and
status always uses `ProxboxVirtualMachineSyncState`; there is no legacy VM
custom-field read path to repair. Migration 0086 removes the remaining thirty
reflection definitions and stale core-object JSON values. Migration 0087 finishes that removal: 0086 compares each field's label against its own definition table, and proxbox-api's inventory reconcile had rewritten the six hardware-discovery labels, so 0086 failed closed and skipped them. 0087 selects candidates by data type plus `ui_editable="hidden"` -- the two attributes both writers agree on -- and then gates the destructive step on the question that does not require guessing provenance NetBox never recorded: **a field holding a value on any row is left alone in full**, definition, bindings and values, whoever wrote it. Only `None` and the empty string count as blank, the check is repeated once the definitions are locked and again as each key is stripped, and the reverse applies it too, so neither a late writer nor a rollback can expose somebody's data as a Proxbox field. Recovery now rebuilds
all reflection state through the typed sidecars; the surviving intent custom
fields are not reflection recovery data.
