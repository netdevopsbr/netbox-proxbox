# Plugin Certification Application Packet

This packet covers the Proxbox plugin family.

## Maintainer Access

The repositories remain under the `emersonfelipesp` GitHub account. NetBox
Labs staff can be invited as collaborators with the access level requested by
the certification process.

## Compatibility Target

The certification matrix covers NetBox `v4.5.8` through `v4.5.10`, `v4.6.0`
through `v4.6.6`, and official `v4.7.0` GA in the **stable** tier. The
plugin declares `min_version = "4.5.8"` and `max_version = "4.7.0"`, sourced
from its vendored `compat.py`. NetBox 4.7.x pre-release builds within the
declared loader range are admitted for evaluation in the **experimental** tier
and receive an advisory warning; they do not change the GA support promise.
The reviewed GA source is NetBox `v4.7.0` at commit
`5f06007e4c9bacc93ce17c1e645fc1143d60df3d`. Each source-matrix cell verifies
the checked-out commit and NetBox release metadata, checksums that commit's
upstream requirements, and enforces a reviewed Python 3.12/Linux dependency
lock with artifact hashes.

**This statement is scoped to `netbox-proxbox` alone.** The companion plugins
(`netbox-ceph`, `netbox-packer`, `netbox-pbs`, `netbox-pdm`) carry the same
vendored `compat.py`, but only in releases published after this change; every
earlier companion artifact still declares `max_version = "4.6.99"`.
A companion left at the old ceiling does **not** fail the boot — `settings.py`
catches `IncompatiblePluginError`, warns, and **skips** that plugin, so NetBox
starts without it. That is the more dangerous outcome for a certification
reader: the symptom is an absence (missing views, REST routes, background jobs)
rather than an error, and a health probe against NetBox still returns 200. Do
not read this section as clearance to move a mixed installation to 4.7. Upgrade
every installed Proxbox-family plugin to a 4.7-capable release first, then
verify each is registered with `apps.is_installed()` rather than inferring it
from a successful start.

NetBox pre-release builds are an **upstream pre-release**. Upstream does not
support pre-releases in production and does not guarantee an upgrade path from
a pre-release to the final release, so the experimental tier is evaluation
evidence on disposable data — not a production certification.

## Evidence

- Every package declares Apache-2.0 license metadata and includes a top-level
  `LICENSE` file.
- Every PyPI package exposes source, documentation, and issue tracker URLs.
- GitHub Actions validate package build, tests, docs, release publishing, and
  NetBox install smoke coverage.
- Screenshot capture workflows use the immutable
  `netboxcommunity/netbox:v4.7.0-5.1.0@sha256:73a54ff279461170032b59a57a1930929965e3ba15c195af59f4b5f6d39a84a9`
  image reference.
- Support is handled through GitHub Issues, with family coordination tracked in
  <https://github.com/emersonfelipesp/netbox-proxbox/issues/499>.
