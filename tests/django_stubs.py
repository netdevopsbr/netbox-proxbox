"""Shared Django stand-ins for the test suite's ``backend_sync`` stub loaders.

Django is not installed in the test environment, so every module that gets
path-loaded runs against hand-built entries in ``sys.modules``.  Six independent
loaders path-load ``views/backend_sync.py`` — ``conftest.load_plugin_module()``,
``test_jobs.load_real_backend_sync()``, and ``_load_backend_sync_module()`` /
``backend_sync_module`` in ``test_multi_endpoint_scoping``,
``test_preflight_diagnosis``, ``test_backend_sync_placement``, and
``test_endpoint_enabled_guards`` — and each builds its own stub set from scratch.
``views/backend_sync.py`` imports ``DatabaseError`` and ``salted_hmac``, so every
one of them needs those two modules; this file is what keeps them from becoming
six divergent copies.

Each loader must install the pair **itself** rather than rely on a sibling's.
Some tests leak a partial ``django.db`` stub into ``sys.modules`` permanently
(``test_hardware_discovery_custom_fields_migration``), and a stub without
``DatabaseError`` fails as ``ImportError: cannot import name 'DatabaseError'
from 'django.db' (unknown location)`` in whichever unrelated test happens to run
next.  ``monkeypatch.setitem`` shadows the leaked entry for the duration of the
test, which is why ``install_django_stubs()`` is the normal entry point.

``salted_hmac`` in particular is implemented *faithfully* rather than stubbed to
a constant.  The code under test fingerprints credentials with it, and a
constant-returning stub would make every fingerprint compare equal — the exact
opposite of what the fingerprint exists to detect.

Only two dotted names are needed.  ``from django.db import DatabaseError`` and
``from django.utils.crypto import salted_hmac`` both hit ``sys.modules`` on the
**full** dotted name before any find-and-load runs, so neither a bare ``django``
entry nor a ``django.utils`` package is required.
