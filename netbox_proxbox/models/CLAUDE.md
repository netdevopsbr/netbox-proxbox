## Main Models

- `EndpointBase`: shared endpoint identity and URL-building fields.
- `ProxmoxEndpoint`: stores Proxmox API connection settings, credentials, mode, and version metadata. Its default-off `allow_packer_template_builds` field is a narrow capability subordinate to endpoint `enabled` and `allow_writes`; it authorizes only netbox-packer Cloud-Init template-image creation, and only the effective three-gate result is propagated to proxbox-api for an independent final-boundary check. `effective_connection_tuning()` owns the nullable endpoint timeout/retry/back-off contract: endpoint values win when not `None` (including zero retries/back-off), otherwise the matching `ProxboxPluginSettings` value is returned, and all three outputs are concrete typed values. The model also carries `pushed_credential_fingerprint` (migration 0074) — the Proxmox twin of the `NetBoxEndpoint` field below, under a distinct HMAC salt so the two namespaces can never compare equal. It lets the preflight's soft push budget detect a secret rotated *in place* (invisible on the wire: `ProxmoxEndpointPublic` withholds `password`/`token_name`/`token_value`) and re-push instead of skipping. Unlike the NetBox twin it fails **toward pushing**: an empty or stale fingerprint costs one extra push, never a blocked run. Written by the push itself with `queryset.update()`, never `save()`, because the model's `post_save` handler re-pushes to the backend.
- `NetBoxEndpoint`: stores the remote NetBox API target and either v1 token or v2 key/secret credentials. Also carries `pushed_credential_fingerprint` (migration 0073) — a keyed HMAC-SHA256 digest of the credentials the last **successful** push handed proxbox-api. It is **not** a credential and must never be treated as one: `salted_hmac` keys the digest off NetBox's `SECRET_KEY`, so it is non-reversible and meaningless outside this install. It exists because `NetBoxEndpointResponse` withholds `token`/`token_key`, leaving an in-place token rotation invisible to any comparison against what the backend returns; the sync-job preflight reads it through `views/backend_sync.py::netbox_push_credentials_unchanged()`. Written by the push itself with `queryset.update()`, never `save()`, because the model's `post_save` handler re-pushes to the backend. An **empty** value means "credentials changed" (fail-closed), so nothing should back-fill it.
- `FastAPIEndpoint`: stores the ProxBox backend HTTP/WebSocket target and its
  encrypted backend token plus the credential-free
  `backend_key_target_fingerprint` that durably binds the token to the exact
  canonical HTTP/fallback-IP/WebSocket/TLS target. Disabled new rows may remain
  intentionally keyless. If stored ciphertext is undecryptable, only an
  explicitly assigned replacement may proceed; it must authenticate against the
  exact enabled target through the normal adoption flow before persistence.
- `PBSEndpoint`: stores Proxmox Backup Server connection settings and credentials for companion inventory/status paths.
- `PDMEndpoint`: stores Proxmox Datacenter Manager connection settings plus declared PVE/PBS federation links.
- `ProxboxPluginSettings`: owns the plugin-at-rest Fernet key. Its redact-all
  `save()` rejects ordinary key clearing/replacement while any encrypted family
  contains ciphertext using the same settings-row and deterministic PostgreSQL
  table-lock protocol as verified rotation. Startup-installed guards also reject
  key writes through both default/base-manager `QuerySet.update()`,
  `bulk_update()`, and conflict-upsert paths. Its custom
  `reset_encrypted_secrets` permission gates the separately destructive recovery
  view. Verified rotation bypasses the queryset guard only through one exact
  settings-locked internal permit.
- `ProxmoxCluster`: stores synchronized cluster metadata and relationships to the source endpoint and NetBox cluster.
- `ProxmoxNode`: stores synchronized hypervisor nodes and their relationships to the source endpoint and NetBox device.
- `ProxmoxMetricsInfluxDB`: stores the InfluxDB URL, organization, bucket, TLS
  flag, enabled state, and plugin-owned Fernet ciphertext for a Proxmox cluster.
  `query_token_enc` is an internal field; the write-only UI/API input encrypts
  through `ProxboxPluginSettings.encryption_key`, while display
  and `serialize_object()` expose only configured/state flags. The backend query
  proxy decrypts only for an authenticated `proxbox-api` request. Database
  checks require every enabled row to retain a nonempty query ciphertext and a
  credential-free HTTPS URL. Migration 0092 clears legacy external references,
  disables affected mappings, and requires credential re-entry.
- `ProxmoxStorage`: stores Proxmox storage inventory synchronized from the
  backend. Its comma-separated `nodes` membership is a `TextField`; Proxmox
  estates with many or long node names must never be truncated to 255
  characters at the model, form, serializer, or database boundary. Because
  NetBox auto-generates a plain `CharFilter` for `TextField`, `filtersets.py`
  explicitly declares `nodes = MultiValueCharFilter()` to preserve the former
  repeated-query and OpenAPI contract.
- `ProxmoxStorageVirtualDisk`: links storage rows to virtual disks.
- `GuestVMInterface`: stores guest-agent OS interface names (for example `ens18`) for a NetBox `VirtualMachine`, mapped **one-to-one** (`OneToOneField`, `SET_NULL`) to the canonical core `VMInterface` (for example `net0`) by MAC. `SET_NULL` (not `CASCADE`) so deleting/recreating the core interface during churn preserves the guest OS inventory row and only clears the link; `vm_interface` is nullable for agent-only interfaces with no matching Proxmox NIC.
- `GuestVMInterfaceAddress`: links a guest OS interface to an existing core `ipam.IPAddress`; it never duplicates IP rows and protects referenced IPs from deletion. `clean()` enforces that the linked IP is the **same object** assigned to the mapped core `VMInterface` (or, for agent-only guests, at least on the same VM) so a bad ID/privileged user can never cross-link a foreign VM's IP.
- `ProxboxSyncStateBase`: abstract base for the custom-field migration
  sidecars. It stores the mirrored source timestamp in
  `proxmox_last_updated` and the backend run identifier in `last_run_id`;
  `last_updated` remains the inherited NetBox row timestamp for change
  tracking and API ETags where the NetBox platform supports them.
- `ProxboxVirtualMachineSyncState`, `ProxboxDeviceSyncState`,
  `ProxboxClusterSyncState`, `ProxboxIPAddressSyncState`,
  `ProxboxInterfaceSyncState`, `ProxboxVLANSyncState`,
  `ProxboxClusterGroupSyncState`, `ProxboxVirtualDiskSyncState`,
  `ProxboxVMInterfaceSyncState`, `ProxboxDeviceRoleSyncState`,
  `ProxboxDeviceTypeSyncState`, `ProxboxManufacturerSyncState`,
  `ProxboxSiteSyncState`, and `ProxboxClusterTypeSyncState`: additive typed
  typed replacements for the 42 legacy reflection custom fields formerly
  written across 14 NetBox core object types. VM/device sidecars reuse existing
  `ProxmoxEndpoint`, `ProxmoxNode`, and `ProxmoxCluster` rows as nullable FKs,
  with text/raw fallback columns for unresolved legacy values. Legacy
  `proxmox_endpoint_id` is stored as `proxmox_endpoint_raw_id` and never
  treated as a plugin `ProxmoxEndpoint` primary key; legacy
  `proxmox_cluster_id` is stored as `proxmox_cluster_raw_id` to avoid
  colliding with the `proxmox_cluster` FK attname. Legacy virtual-disk storage
  and VM-interface bridge JSON values preserve unresolved numeric IDs in
  `proxbox_storage_raw_id` / `proxbox_bridge_raw_id` and malformed or
  non-numeric payloads in `proxbox_storage_raw_value` /
  `proxbox_bridge_raw_value`. The VM sidecar also owns
  `proxmox_last_synced_role_id`, a nullable scalar DeviceRole primary-key
  snapshot. It intentionally is not a foreign key: deleting a role must not
  erase the evidence used to distinguish a sync-managed value from an operator
  edit. proxbox-api reads this typed value first and persists it only after a
  successful VM reconcile.
- `ProxmoxVMIntent`: operator-owned desired state linked one-to-one to a core
  `VirtualMachine`. It stores target node/storage, ISO or template placement,
  LXC swap/rootfs/template values, and cloud-init input. `intent_state` and
  `last_apply_run_id` are apply-job-managed stamps and are excluded from the
  operator form and writable API fields. An existing row belongs to its parent
  VM for its lifetime; both the form and API serializer reject reassignment.
  Desired `target_node` must never be used as the reflected current node for
  deletion authorization.
- `ProxboxBranchIntent`: stores the per-branch `apply_to_proxmox` and
  `apply_destroy_confirmed` safety gates without importing or depending on the
  optional branching model. Both default to false. Runtime readers must use the
  shared resolver, which also returns false when the companion is disabled, the
  branch is deleted, the intent row is absent, or a lookup fails.
- `BackupRoutine`: stores backup routine inventory for NetBox-backed ProxBox sync.
- `Replication`: stores replication job inventory for NetBox-backed ProxBox sync.
- `VMBackup`: stores backup inventory for NetBox virtual machines.
- `VMSnapshot`: stores snapshot inventory for NetBox virtual machines.
- `VMTaskHistory`: stores VM task history records linked to NetBox virtual machines.
- `ProxmoxServiceCollection`, `ProxmoxServiceSample`, and
  `ProxmoxServiceStatus`: store asynchronous netbox-rpc systemctl service
  collection history, raw per-run samples, and latest projected service state
  for opt-in Proxmox endpoint service monitoring. The systemd `id` property is
  stored as `service_id` to avoid colliding with the NetBox row primary key.
- `ProxboxPluginSettings`: singleton settings for plugin runtime behavior.
  Physical-NIC MAC reflection is controlled by
  `hardware_discovery_sync_nic_macs=False` in addition to the
  `hardware_discovery_enabled` master flag, so upgrades remain write-neutral
  until an operator explicitly enables the MAC behavior in the UI.

## Dependencies

- Inbound: forms, tables, filtersets, views, serializers, and migrations all rely on these model definitions.
- Outbound: NetBox core model base classes plus related objects in `dcim`, `ipam`, `users`, and `virtualization`.

## Notes

- `CommonProperties` and `EndpointBase` centralize endpoint URL semantics.
- `EndpointBase.enabled` is operational: `False` means inventory-only. Service, startup, OpenAPI, and sync code must return before any backend or remote-service connection attempt for disabled endpoint-like rows. The one signal exception is a normal disabled `ProxmoxEndpoint.save()`: after commit it may authenticate to proxbox-api solely to revoke `enabled` and `allow_packer_template_builds` on an already existing backend row; it must not contact Proxmox, create a backend row, or send endpoint credentials. `ProxmoxEndpoint.packer_template_builds_backend_authorized` records the last successfully confirmed effective narrow grant. Deletion and local-only bulk toggles stay blocked while either it or the desired narrow flag is true. Bulk enable/disable uses `queryset.update()` and remains local-only.
- `FastAPIEndpoint.websocket_url` is distinct from the backend HTTP URL and is used by `websocket_client.py`.
- `FastAPIEndpoint.save()` is the backend-key persistence boundary. New enabled
  endpoints, disabled-to-enabled transitions, connection/TLS target changes,
  and token changes must pass `prepare_backend_key_transition()` before
  `token_enc` is written. An explicitly submitted candidate is authenticated
  synchronously. When the field is blank, an existing encrypted key is reused
  or a new candidate is encrypted, and bounded authentication is scheduled
  only after commit. A disabled existing row cannot accept a replacement token
  because the hard no-connection gate prevents authenticating it.
  Security-sensitive saves lock and compare the loaded ciphertext/target
  snapshot, while explicitly non-security
  `update_fields` saves cannot widen their field set or restore stale trust
  state. Runtime HTTP and WebSocket paths recompute
  `backend_key_target_fingerprint` (including a fresh IP FK lookup) before
  exposing the key; target drift remains blocked until the exact persisted
  target has been re-authenticated.
- `NetBoxEndpoint.has_configured_token` and serializer/form validation together define the remote NetBox credential behavior.
- Primary endpoint secrets are exposed as compatibility properties and stored in
  encrypted backing fields: `ProxmoxEndpoint.password_enc`,
  `ProxmoxEndpoint.token_value_enc`, `FastAPIEndpoint.token_enc`,
  `PBSEndpoint.token_secret_enc`, and `PDMEndpoint.token_secret_enc`. Use the
  public properties (`password`, `token_value`, `token`, `token_secret`) in
  service code and serializers; never add plaintext model fields for these
  secrets.
- `ProxmoxEndpoint.ssh_credential_source` controls the proxbox-native endpoint
  SSH credential surface used by the browser terminal. The default
  `dedicated` mode keeps the encrypted `ssh_*_enc` behavior unchanged.
  `reuse_endpoint` mode derives `effective_ssh_username` from
  `username.split("@", 1)[0]` and treats the endpoint plaintext `password` as
  the SSH password; it still requires `ssh_host` and
  `ssh_known_host_fingerprint`.
- `ProxmoxEndpoint.service_monitoring_enabled` is gated by
  `service_monitoring_eligible`, which is true only when `allow_writes`,
  `ssh_access_enabled`, `has_ssh_terminal_credentials`, and
  `effective_rpc_enabled()` are all true (an RPC-disabled endpoint is excluded
  because each collection tick would 403 at the backend RPC gate). The
  collector creates asynchronous netbox-rpc executions; this plugin does not
  perform SSH itself.
- `ProxboxPluginSettings` is the singleton home for runtime tunables shared with the
  `proxbox-api` backend (timeouts, concurrency, batch sizes, cache limits, diagnostic
  flags). Add new tunables here rather than as fresh `PROXBOX_*` env vars on the
  backend; the backend reads them through `proxbox_api.runtime_settings.get_*` which
  resolves env > plugin settings > default. See
  [top-level `CLAUDE.md` → Plugin settings and configuration](../../CLAUDE.md) and
  migration [`0037_pluginsettings_runtime_tunables.py`](../migrations/0037_pluginsettings_runtime_tunables.py)
  for the migration shape (`SeparateDatabaseAndState` + `IF NOT EXISTS`).
- Proxmox connection defaults are `proxmox_timeout=5`,
  `proxmox_max_retries=0`, and `proxmox_retry_backoff=0.50`. Keep operator docs,
  model defaults, and backend registration payloads aligned with those values.
- Ceph control-plane defaults are `ceph_task_timeout=300.00`,
  `ceph_task_poll_interval=1.00`, and `ceph_run_lease_seconds=360.00`.
  All three are bounded DecimalFields exposed to proxbox-api through the
  singleton settings API; model/form/serializer validation also requires the
  polling interval not to exceed the task timeout. The backend snapshots and
  normalizes them once, independently renews and persists the run lease, so do
  not replace them with mutable process-local constants.
- `ProxboxPluginSettings.vm_interface_sync_strategy` defaults to `guest_os_model`.
  This strategy keeps Proxmox config NICs as core `virtualization.VMInterface`
  rows named `net0`/`net1` and stores guest-agent names in `GuestVMInterface`.
  The `legacy_rename` strategy is retained only for the old single-interface
  rename behavior controlled by deprecated `use_guest_agent_interface_name`.
- `ProxboxClusterSyncState` is intentionally separate from `ProxmoxCluster`.
  `ProxmoxCluster` is endpoint-scoped and unique by `(endpoint, name)` with a
  nullable FK to `virtualization.Cluster`; it is not a one-to-one extension of
  NetBox's core cluster model. Keep custom-field backfill on the sidecar unless
  that cardinality changes.
- The typed sidecars are now the **standard** source of truth. Migrations
  0065/0066 created and backfilled them; the proxbox-api writer/reader switch has
  landed, so a normal sync writes and reads the sidecars and rebuilds them from
  live Proxmox data. Migration 0085 removes the twelve VM-only reflection
  custom fields and their stale core-VM JSON keys. All VM identity readers must
  use `vm_identity.py` and `ProxboxVirtualMachineSyncState`; do not restore the
  removed `custom_fields_enabled` setting or a custom-field fallback. Migration
  0086 removes the other thirty reflection definitions and stale JSON values.
  Migration 0087 finishes that removal: 0086 compares each field's label against its own definition table, and proxbox-api's inventory reconcile had rewritten the six hardware-discovery labels, so 0086 failed closed and skipped them. 0087 selects candidates by data type plus `ui_editable="hidden"` -- the two attributes both writers agree on -- and then gates the destructive step on the question that does not require guessing provenance NetBox never recorded: **a field holding a value on any row is left alone in full**, definition, bindings and values, whoever wrote it. Only `None` and the empty string count as blank, the check is repeated once the definitions are locked and again as each key is stripped, and the reverse applies it too, so neither a late writer nor a rollback can expose somebody's data as a Proxbox field.
  Detail-page cards read only `obj.proxbox_sync_state` and remain absent when no
  sidecar exists. The surviving `proxmox_node` and `proxmox_storage` custom
  fields are live CREATE-placement inputs, not reflection fallbacks.
- Concurrency known limitation: on NetBox 4.5.x, sync-state sidecar REST APIs
  do not emit ETags and do not enforce `If-Match`, matching the platform
  behavior for all endpoints on that release. Optimistic concurrency is
  available on NetBox 4.6+. Automated writers should treat sidecar rows as
  proxbox-api-owned during the additive phase.
- Cloud-customer network discovery fields also live on `ProxboxPluginSettings`:
  `cloud_network_lock_enabled`, `cloud_customer_prefix_id`,
  `cloud_customer_bridge`, `cloud_customer_vlan_tag`, and
  `cloud_customer_gateway`. They are populated by the
  `ensure_cloud_customer_network` management command so proxbox-api and
  nms-backend discover the designated customer network from NetBox instead of
  hardcoded estate constants.
