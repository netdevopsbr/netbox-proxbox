"""Best-effort scrubbing of identifying data out of Proxbox bug reports.

A failed sync job's ``error`` string and ``log_entries`` routinely embed details
an operator should not publish to a public issue tracker: Proxmox node
hostnames and FQDNs, management IP addresses, API URLs, ``user@pam`` realm
principals, ``PVEAPIToken`` values, and ``Authorization`` headers. The bug
report feature exists to get that text *out* of the NetBox instance and into
the public issue tracker, so scrubbing has to happen before the text is handed
to the operator -- not after.

Two properties drive the design:

* **Stable placeholders.** The same input value always maps to the same token
  (``<ip-1>``, ``<host-2>``) for the lifetime of one :class:`Anonymizer`, so a
  reader can still tell "the node that timed out is the same one that failed
  the storage check" without learning what it is called.
* **No Django.** ``tests/test_bug_report.py`` exec-loads
  :mod:`netbox_proxbox.bug_report` with only ``core.choices`` stubbed, so this
  module -- which that one imports -- must stay pure ``re`` + stdlib.

Scrubbing is deliberately **fail-closed**: an ambiguous match is redacted
rather than preserved. It is still best-effort, and the modal says so. In
particular, a bare single-label Proxmox node name (``pve-node-01``) appearing
in prose is indistinguishable from any other identifier and is only caught when
it appears in a URL or another positionally-identifiable slot.

Every quantifier that precedes a required literal is **bounded**. Log text is
remote-controlled, so an unbounded greedy class in front of an absent literal
is a denial-of-service vector, not a style question -- see ``_URL_RE`` and
``_FQDN_RE`` for the measurements.

# meet in a dependency-free module instead of each carrying a copy.
#
# Three properties matter, and an earlier exact-key/line-anchored version failed
# all three:
#
# * **The key is matched by marker, not by exact name.** ``token_value`` and
#   ``token_secret`` are real field names on this plugin's own models, and
#   ``X-Proxbox-API-Key`` is a real header; an enumerated key list missed every
#   one of them.
# * **Assignments are found anywhere in the text, in both ``:`` and ``=``
#   forms.** Anchoring the ``:`` form to the start of a line made it dead code
#   in practice: ``_format_log_lines`` prepends ``[timestamp] LEVEL `` before
#   anything is scrubbed, so a log message that *begins* with an
#   ``Authorization:`` header is never at column zero by the time it gets here.
#   That also means a passing test can prove nothing unless its fixture carries
#   the prefix a real log line has.
# * **A bare ``Bearer <jwt>`` is swept independently**, because a credential
#   quoted into prose has no key in front of it to match on.
# The value of an assignment, matched at the offset just past its separator.
# The scheme alternative must come first: ``Authorization: Bearer <jwt>``
# otherwise matches the value ``Bearer`` alone, which redacts the *keyword* and
# leaves the token behind it in the clear -- and then hides it from the scheme
# sweep below, which no longer sees a scheme to anchor on.
#
# The quoted alternatives are escape-aware (a plain ``"[^"]*"`` ends at the
# first ``\"`` inside a JSON-escaped value and publishes the remainder) and
# possessive, so an unterminated quote fails at once instead of re-scanning.
