This directory contains the NetBox plugin API surface for ProxBox. It exposes the API root, the nested plugin endpoint namespace, model-backed viewsets and serializers for the plugin's persisted objects, and non-model `APIView` classes that mirror every data-bearing UI page.

Endpoint SSH reuse returns static 503 responses for unresolved stored passwords,
without forwarding provider errors. A token-only endpoint with no password
retains its 422 response. Required resolvers remain strict; readiness properties
used by endpoint list serializers contain expected storage exceptions.

## Files And Ownership

- [`__init__.py`](./__init__.py): package marker.
- [`urls.py`](./urls.py): API routing for the plugin root, endpoint namespace, non-model views, and model viewsets.
- [`views.py`](./views.py): `APIRootView` subclasses, `NetBoxModelViewSet` classes, and non-model `APIView` classes (see table below).
- [`mcp_bridge.py`](./mcp_bridge.py): pure version 1 semantic-tool manifest backed by existing DRF routes; it must not import FastMCP, netbox-sdk, or credentials.
- [`jobs.py`](./jobs.py): `ProxboxJobCancelAPIView` — `POST jobs/<pk>/cancel/`, the JSON mirror of the UI `proxbox-cancel` action so a stuck/zombie Proxbox sync `core.Job` can be cleared through the nms-backend proxy without the UI (today `nms virt raw POST jobs/<pk>/cancel/`; a first-class `nms virt cancel-job` wrapper is the paired nms-cli follow-up). Reuses `views/job_cancel.py::cancel_rq_job_for_netbox_job()` + `jobs.is_proxbox_sync_job()` + `Job.terminate()`; gated on `core.delete_job`.
- [`filters.py`](./filters.py): additional filter utilities used by the API router if needed.
- [`serializers/`](./serializers): package of API serializers for endpoints, clusters, storage, backups, snapshots, task history, backup routines, replications, and the non-model resource/schedule serializers in `resource_views.py`. The `pbs_pdm.py` module provides serializers for `PBSEndpoint`, `PDMEndpoint`, and `PDMRemote`; `intent.py` provides read-only serializers for `DeletionRequest` and `ProxmoxApplyJob`.

## Model Viewsets

These follow the standard `NetBoxModelViewSet` + `NetBoxRouter` pattern:

Firecracker host-pool and image-template serializers expose `allowed_tenants` as
the NMS Cloud tenant visibility contract. Omitting `allowed_tenants` on create or
partial update leaves existing grants untouched; sending an explicit list,
including `[]`, replaces the many-to-many set. Keep
`FirecrackerHostPoolSerializer` and `FirecrackerImageTemplateSerializer`
`create()` / `update()` methods explicitly typed and covered by
`tests/test_firecracker_cloud_contracts.py` when changing this behavior.

The `sync-state/` routes expose typed mirrors of the old custom-field surface:
`virtual-machines`, `devices`, `clusters`, `ip-addresses`, `interfaces`,
`vlans`, `cluster-groups`, `virtual-disks`, `vm-interfaces`, `device-roles`,
`device-types`, `manufacturers`, `sites`, and `cluster-types`. They are
sidecar rows keyed one-to-one to NetBox core objects. Keep them additive until
the paired proxbox-api writer/readers switch away from custom fields.
Every sync-state viewset must also restrict rows through the caller's
visibility to the one-to-one parent object, and writable nested parent
relations must resolve through the caller-restricted parent queryset. Sidecar
permissions alone must not reveal or attach hidden core objects. The
`proxbox_storage` and `proxbox_bridge` writable relations follow the same
request-restricted resolution rule, and sidecar rows that would disclose hidden
storage or bridge objects are filtered out of API responses. Nested
endpoint/node/cluster representations are also masked when the caller lacks
view permission on those related objects. Duplicate or occupied parent preflight
returns `409`; changing an existing sidecar to a free different parent remains a
`400` validation error, and device/node plus cluster/proxmox-cluster writes must
point back to the same NetBox parent.
On NetBox 4.5.x, these sidecar APIs do not emit ETags and do not enforce
`If-Match`; that is a platform limitation affecting all endpoints on that
release. Optimistic concurrency is available on NetBox 4.6+. Automated writers
should treat sidecar rows as proxbox-api-owned during the additive migration
phase.

## Non-Model API Views

These `APIView` subclasses mirror every data-bearing UI page and expose the same aggregated data as JSON. `PluginMCPManifestAPIView` is the read-only bridge descriptor. All are GET-only except `ScheduleSyncAPIView` (also POST) and `ProxboxJobCancelAPIView` (POST-only).

| View class | Route | Mirrors UI page | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PluginMCPManifestAPIView` | `mcp/` | n/a — semantic bridge descriptor | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `ProxboxJobCancelAPIView` | `jobs/<pk>/cancel/` | `proxbox-cancel` (Job detail **Cancel job**) | `_ProxboxJobCancelPermission` (`core.delete_job`) |
| `HomeAPIView` | `home/` | `/plugins/proxbox/` | `_ProxboxDashboardPermission` |
| `DashboardAPIView` | `dashboard/` | `/plugins/proxbox/dashboard/` | `_ProxboxDashboardPermission` |
| `NodesAPIView` | `resources/nodes/` | `/plugins/proxbox/nodes/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `VirtualMachinesAPIView` | `resources/virtual-machines/` | `/plugins/proxbox/virtual_machines/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `VirtualMachineProxmoxTagsAPIView` | `resources/virtual-machines/<pk>/proxmox-tags/` | — | `core.run_proxmox_action`; PUT/PATCH forwards to proxbox-api `/proxmox/{qemu\|lxc}/{vmid}/tags` |
| `LXCContainerProxmoxTagsAPIView` | `resources/lxc-containers/<pk>/proxmox-tags/` | — | same as QEMU variant, rejects vm_type mismatch |
| `LXCContainersAPIView` | `resources/lxc-containers/` | `/plugins/proxbox/lxc_containers/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `InterfacesAPIView` | `resources/interfaces/` | `/plugins/proxbox/interfaces/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `IPAddressesAPIView` | `resources/ip-addresses/` | `/plugins/proxbox/ip-addresses/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `VirtualDisksAPIView` | `resources/virtual-disks/` | `/plugins/proxbox/virtual-disks/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `ScheduleSyncAPIView` | `sync/schedule/` | `/plugins/proxbox/sync/schedule/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` + `core.add_job` check |
| `BackendLogsAPIView` | `logs/` | `/plugins/proxbox/logs/` | `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` |
| `ProxmoxServiceMonitoringRefreshAPIView` | `endpoints/proxmox/{id}/services/refresh/` | Proxmox endpoint Services tab refresh | `IsAuthenticated` + `change_proxmoxendpoint` + endpoint service-monitoring eligibility |

### Permission notes

- `_ProxboxDashboardPermission` wraps `user_may_access_proxbox_dashboard()` and allows unauthenticated access only when `settings.LOGIN_REQUIRED` is `False`, matching the `ConditionalLoginRequiredMixin` UI behavior.
- `IsAuthenticatedOrLoginNotRequired` (from `netbox.api.authentication`) allows anonymous API access when `LOGIN_REQUIRED=False`, matching `ConditionalLoginRequiredMixin` on the UI side.
- `ScheduleSyncAPIView.get()` and `ScheduleSyncAPIView.post()` both invoke `_check_enqueue_permission()`, which verifies the caller holds `core.add_job` (same permission gate as the UI `ContentTypePermissionRequiredMixin`).
- `ScheduleSyncAPIView.post()` rejects an explicit `proxmox_endpoint_ids` list if any ID is unknown or disabled, before enqueueing. Never filter such a list down to empty: `ProxboxSyncJob` interprets an empty list as the deliberate all-enabled scope.

### Non-model serializers

`serializers/resource_views.py` holds lightweight `serializers.Serializer` subclasses used for OpenAPI documentation of these views:

- `DeviceResourceSerializer` — nodes list items
- `VirtualMachineResourceSerializer` — VM and LXC items
- `InterfaceResourceSerializer` — interface list items
- `IPAddressResourceSerializer` — IP address items
- `VirtualDiskResourceSerializer` — virtual disk items
- `ScheduledJobSerializer` — GET `/sync/schedule/` response rows
- `ScheduleSyncRequestSerializer` — POST `/sync/schedule/` input body

### API root

`ProxBoxRootView.get()` extends the DRF root response with keys for every non-model URL group: `home`, `dashboard`, `resources` (nested dict with all six sub-paths), `schedule_sync`, and `logs`. It adds the `mcp` schema/version and exact plugin-local manifest path only when `mcp_bridge_is_active()` proves one complete immutable SDK identity; while blocked, the root omits `mcp` and the direct manifest route returns 503 with the activation record.

The manifest describes only existing routes. Keep its request and response
schemas aligned with the DRF serializers and views, and keep runtime permission
checks in those target views. Never add a plugin-local MCP server, credential
store, or direct transport client. Once an exact compatible identity is
activated, the paired SDK exposes generic
`plugin_list_tools` / `plugin_call_tool`, and its mutation opt-in is global to
all writes rather than scoped to this plugin. `schedule_sync` must retain its destructive
effect/hint because reconciliation may delete stale NetBox inventory records.
`ScheduleSyncRequestSerializer` distinguishes bridge `sync_stages` from legacy
REST `sync_types`, translates only after validation, and preserves the legacy
flat recurrence / NetBox scope / ordinary DRF date parser without advertising
them. Bridge `sync_stages` selects the strict RFC 3339 parser. Bridge v1 rejects
`all`, `netbox_endpoint_ids`, explicitly empty Proxmox scopes, unknown fields,
duplicate list values, nonpositive endpoint IDs, timezone-less dates, invalid
RFC 3339 (including leap-second normalization overflow), recurrence objects with other
than one supported unit, converted intervals above `2147483647`, and job names
longer than 200 characters. `ScheduledJobSerializer` owns the advertised response
row. Never auto-retry an ambiguous write outcome: the list response lacks scope
and stable request identity.

`sync_stages` controls the 13 backend SSE stages, not the invariant job
prepasses. MCP-scheduled jobs still run endpoint/configuration preflight and
scoped cluster/node, firewall, and datacenter CPU reconciliation; VM-template
reconciliation runs unless its sync mode is disabled. Document that mutation
surface wherever stage selection is shown.

Endpoint fields accept signed-64-bit positive PKs. Integer JSON literals retain
the full range; finite integral float/Decimal forms normalize only through
`9007199254740991`, and unsafe larger floats, booleans, strings, fractions,
non-finite numbers, and out-of-range IDs reject before ORM lookup. The exact complete unique 13-stage bridge set translates to `[all]`
after validation; every subset remains explicit. This is required for recurring
schedule hints and repair debounce.

Schema version 1 is the generic SDK descriptor protocol, not a frozen plugin
payload. `tests/fixtures/proxbox_bridge_v1.json` is the Proxbox-owned contract
snapshot. The pure suite pins generation to it. No released SDK is activated;
`tests/fixtures/netbox_sdk_bridge_activation.json` remains blocked. The manual
`tests/validate_paired_netbox_sdk_bridge.py` requires an explicit SDK checkout
whose complete package inventory matches the exact full commit, plus a fixed
relative module origin, then imports only
package blobs materialized from that commit after bounded object-graph
verification and explicit blob rehashing, under an exact released version and
isolated locked interpreter/dependency environment before validating the real
`PluginManifest` plus argument and response validators; ambient `PYTHONPATH`,
dirty source, and a spoofed version are never identity evidence. Add it to CI
only with explicit immutable SDK provisioning.
The SDK repository does not own or copy this fixture.
The named JSON blocks in `docs/api/semantic-mcp-bridge.md` are parsed by
`tests/test_mcp_bridge_docs.py`; real-Django tests submit the request examples
through the actual route and assert exact enqueue or fail-closed behavior.

## Dependencies

- Inbound: the NetBox plugin API router imports this package to expose `/api/plugins/proxbox/...`.
- Outbound: `netbox_proxbox.models`, `netbox_proxbox.filtersets`, `netbox_proxbox.utils.get_proxbox_tagged_object_ids`, NetBox serializer/viewset base classes, nested serializers from `ipam`, `dcim`, and `virtualization`, and `users.Token`.

## Notes

- `NetBoxEndpointSerializer` is the main place where v1 versus v2 remote NetBox credential rules are enforced for API writes.
- `FastAPIEndpointSerializer` uses
  `BackendKeyAdoptionValidationMixin` to translate the model's fail-closed
  backend-key gate into a DRF `400` validation response. API create, update, and
  partial-update paths therefore preserve the prior encrypted token when a
  candidate is rejected or the backend cannot be reached.
- `ProxmoxEndpointSerializer` marks password and token value fields write-only
  and exposes `ssh_credential_source` for endpoint browser-terminal SSH
  configuration.
- `ProxmoxEndpointSSHCredentialSecretsAPIView` preserves the proxbox-api payload
  shape (`host`, `username`, `port`, `auth_method`, fingerprint, booleans,
  `password`, `private_key`). In `reuse_endpoint` mode it returns the
  realm-stripped endpoint username, `auth_method=password`, the endpoint
  plaintext password, and an empty private key without requiring the plugin
  encryption key. The dedicated mode still decrypts `ssh_*_enc` fields and
  returns `503` when the encryption key is missing. **Security:** `reuse_endpoint`
  means this endpoint returns the Proxmox API password, so the `open_ssh_terminal`
  permission (required alongside `view` here) effectively grants retrieval of that
  password — scope it to operators already trusted with the endpoint credentials.
  Token-only endpoints (no stored password) get `422` from this view.
- Proxmox endpoint service-monitoring fields are exposed on
  `ProxmoxEndpointSerializer`, but decrypted SSH material is not. The refresh
  API only queues an async `netbox-rpc` execution for the read-only
  `os.linux.proxmox.show_systemctl_services` procedure. It requires
  `change_proxmoxendpoint` and the same eligibility gate as the UI:
  `allow_writes=True`, `access_methods="api_ssh"`, complete endpoint SSH
  credentials, and netbox-rpc installed and effectively enabled for the
  endpoint. `netbox-rpc` remains a soft optional dependency and must be imported
  only inside call-time `try/except ImportError` blocks.
- `NodeHostKeyFingerprintAPIView`
  (`GET ssh-credentials/by-node/<node_id>/host-key-fingerprint/`) backs the
  **"Fetch host key"** button in the **Terminal-tab credential modal** for
  **node** targets. Session-gated by `_ProxmoxEndpointOpenTerminalPermission`
  (`open_ssh_terminal`, the same permission that renders the tab). It resolves
  the node IP server-side, honors the modal `?port=` (default 22), enforces the
  owning endpoint's SSH access method (403 when `access_methods='api'`), and
  proxies to proxbox-api `GET /ssh/host-key-fingerprint`. No credential is sent
  or returned (public host key only); degrades gracefully (no host → 422, no
  backend → 503, old proxbox-api without the route → 503, upstream error → 502).
  The operator reviews/accepts the fingerprint before it is pinned for a
  one-shot session or persisted on a stored `NodeSSHCredential`.
- `ProxmoxEndpointHostKeyFingerprintAPIView`
  (`GET ssh-credentials/by-endpoint/<id>/host-key-fingerprint/`) backs the
  **"Fetch host key"** button on the SSH-settings tab (and the endpoint-target
  Terminal-tab modal). It is **session-gated**
  (`_ProxmoxEndpointChangePermission` → `change_proxmoxendpoint`), resolves the
  endpoint host (`ssh_host`) + `ssh_port` server-side, and proxies to proxbox-api
  `GET /ssh/host-key-fingerprint` (via `get_fastapi_request_context`, X-Proxbox-API-Key),
  returning `{host, port, fingerprint, key_type}` to auto-fill the pinned
  `ssh_known_host_fingerprint` for operator review. No credential is sent or
  returned (public host key only). Degrades gracefully: no host → `422`,
  no backend → `503`, backend without the route (old proxbox-api) → `503`,
  unreachable/upstream error → `502`. The operator still confirms the pin before
  Save — no silent auto-trust.
- Resource views use `get_proxbox_tagged_object_ids()` from `netbox_proxbox/utils.py` to look up objects tagged `proxbox` without repeating the `TaggedItem` query pattern.
- `DashboardAPIView` makes live HTTP calls to the proxbox-api backend to fetch current cluster/VM statistics; it returns partial data (with error context) when the backend is unreachable rather than failing the entire request.
- Contract tests for this API layer live in `tests/test_api_source_contracts.py`.
