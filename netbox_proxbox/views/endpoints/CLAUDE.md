This directory contains NetBox generic model views for the three endpoint models.

## Files And Ownership

- [`proxmox.py`](./proxmox.py): list/detail/edit/delete, bulk enable/disable, bulk import, export, quick-add-token, and tab views for `ProxmoxEndpoint`. Includes `ProxmoxEndpointSyncJobsTabView` (weight 875, path `sync-jobs`) which lists Proxbox sync jobs scoped to the viewed endpoint — jobs whose `proxbox_sync.params.proxmox_endpoint_ids` contains the endpoint PK, or jobs with an empty endpoint list (all-endpoint jobs). The shared module-level helper `endpoint_sync_jobs_for(request, instance)` builds that list. This `ObjectView` also **handles POST** (the tab's "Create Sync Job" modal): it delegates gating + enqueue to `schedule_sync.handle_endpoint_sync_routine_post()` and maps the outcome to a response — `403` when the user lacks `core.add_job`, a redirect back to the tab on success/disabled-refusal/enqueue-error (flash message already posted), or a re-render of the tab with the bound `ScheduleSyncForm` + `show_create_modal=True` so the modal reopens showing field errors. The routine is **hard-scoped server-side to the viewed endpoint** — both `proxmox_endpoint_ids=[endpoint.pk]` (passed to `ProxboxSyncJob.enqueue` **directly**, so an empty list can never fall through to an all-endpoints sync — fail-closed) and `netbox_endpoint_ids=[]` (the tab never exposes the NetBox-endpoint picker) — so a crafted POST cannot retarget either side. Scheduling is entirely NetBox-native (`core.Job` + `ProxboxSyncJob` + django_rq) — **no NMS dependency**. Contracts in `tests/test_sync_jobs_create_contracts.py`; handler behavior in `tests/test_endpoint_sync_job_create.py`. Also includes `ProxmoxEndpointOverwriteBehaviorView` (weight 905, path `overwrite-behavior`), a read-only **Overwrite Behavior** tab that moved the former detail-page "Sync Overwrite Behavior" card onto its own tab and splits the `overwrite_*` flags into per-category Bootstrap sub-tabs (`_build_overwrite_row_groups()` over `OVERWRITE_FIELD_GROUPS`).
- `ProxmoxEndpointServicesView` (weight 930, path `services`) renders latest
  projected systemd service status and recent collection history. GET calls
  `project_completed_collections()` to reconcile already-finished netbox-rpc
  executions. POST is the **Refresh now** action and only queues
  `collect_systemctl_services()` when the requester can change the endpoint and
  `service_monitoring_eligible` is true.
- [`proxmox_sync_now.py`](./proxmox_sync_now.py): POST-only `ProxmoxEndpoint` action that queues an immediate full `ProxboxSyncJob` scoped to the endpoint being viewed.
- [`proxmox_export.py`](./proxmox_export.py): CSV/JSON/YAML export fieldname and serializer helpers for `ProxmoxEndpoint`.
- [`netbox.py`](./netbox.py): list/detail/edit/delete, bulk import, export, and quick-add-token views for `NetBoxEndpoint`.
- [`netbox_export.py`](./netbox_export.py): CSV/JSON/YAML export fieldname and serializer helpers for `NetBoxEndpoint`.
- [`fastapi.py`](./fastapi.py): list/detail/edit/delete, bulk import, export, quick-add-token views for `FastAPIEndpoint`, plus the OpenAPI tab that renders cached schema metadata. The backend token is optional for bounded creation/enable/target auto-configuration; views/forms/serializers must continue to converge on the model persistence gate rather than implementing an alternate discovery path.
- [`fastapi_export.py`](./fastapi_export.py): CSV/JSON/YAML export fieldname and serializer helpers for `FastAPIEndpoint`.
- [`pdm.py`](./pdm.py): the local `PDMEndpoint` detail override plus its Sync
  Now action. The discovered-remotes table must start from
  `PDMRemote.objects.restrict(request.user, "view")`; permission to view the
  parent endpoint never implies permission to view all child remotes, and
  object-level remote constraints must remain effective.
- [`ssh_terminal_credential.py`](./ssh_terminal_credential.py): pure, NetBox-free helpers for the Terminal-tab SSH credential modal — `validate_terminal_credential()` (normalizes the operator-entered credential: username/port/auth-method/secret/fingerprint, with a mandatory host-key fingerprint) and `one_shot_payload()` (builds the proxbox-api `one_shot_credential` body). `proxmox.py`'s `ProxmoxEndpointSSHTerminalSessionView` imports these; its POST and stored-credential helper mark all reporter locals sensitive, convert expected encryption failures into a secret-free 503, and let unexpected database failures propagate only through redacted frames. The pure helpers are unit-tested in `tests/test_ssh_terminal_credential.py`; the reporter boundary is covered by the real-Django encryption-recovery suite.
- [`__init__.py`](./__init__.py): re-exports endpoint view classes.

## Export Views

Proxmox sensitive export uses `resolve_endpoint_api_credentials`: an absent,
unselected password or token is omitted, but required or referenced OpenBao
material must resolve successfully. Provider failure never produces an apparently
successful export containing an empty required secret.

All three endpoint types expose an `ExportView` at `{model}_export` that supports CSV, JSON, and YAML output in two modes:

- **Safe export** (GET or POST without `include_sensitive=true`): Excludes all credential fields. Anyone with `view` permission on the model can download.
- **Sensitive export** (POST with `include_sensitive=true`): Includes credential fields in plain text. The requester must POST a valid NetBox API token to prove identity.

### Sensitive export token validation

`_validate_sensitive_export_token()` supports three input modes, selected by the `token_version` POST field:

| Mode | POST fields | Header constructed |
|---|---|---|
| `v1` (dropdown) | `token_id` (integer PK) | `Token <plaintext from DB>` |
| `v1` (manual) | `v1_manual_token` (raw value) | `Token <value>` |
| `v2` | `token_key` + `token_secret` | `Bearer <key>.<secret>` |
| Fallback (empty) | `netbox_token` | `Token <value>` or `Bearer <value>` |

The constructed header is placed into `request.META["HTTP_AUTHORIZATION"]` and authenticated with `TokenAuthentication`. The token user must also hold `view` permission on the exported model.

### Quick-add token views

Each endpoint type registers a `QuickAddTokenView` at `{model}_quick_add_token`. A POST to this endpoint creates a temporary v1 `Token` object under the current user's account and returns its PK, display string, and plaintext once in JSON. The export modal UI uses this to create a throwaway token when the user has no existing v1 token handy.

### Export helper modules

Each `*_export.py` file provides two functions used by the `ExportView`:

- `_*_export_fieldnames(include_sensitive)` — returns the ordered tuple of column names; credential columns appear only when `include_sensitive=True`.
- `_serialize_*_endpoint(endpoint, include_sensitive)` — serializes one model instance to a `dict[str, str]` row for CSV, JSON, or YAML output.

**Sensitive columns by model:**

| Model | Sensitive fields |
|---|---|
| `ProxmoxEndpoint` | `password`, `token_value` |
| `NetBoxEndpoint` | `token_key`, `token_secret` |
| `FastAPIEndpoint` | `token` |

## Bulk Import Views

All three endpoint types override `create_and_update_objects()` to strip any `id` column before NetBox processes the records. This makes CSV exports from one NetBox instance importable into another without "Object with ID N does not exist" errors; PKs are auto-assigned on create.

### Singleton import confirmation

`NetBoxEndpoint` and `FastAPIEndpoint` are singletons — the backend and dashboard always use the first row of each. Their `BulkImportView` subclasses enforce this constraint:

1. On the initial import POST, if a record already exists and `confirm_override` is not set, the view renders `singleton_import_confirm.html` with the raw POST data preserved in hidden fields.
2. The user reviews the existing record summary and clicks **Override existing** (adds `confirm_override=true` and re-submits) or **Cancel**.
3. On the confirmed POST, `create_and_update_objects()` deletes the existing singleton, then calls `super()` to create the replacement.

`ProxmoxEndpoint` allows multiple rows and has no confirmation step.

## IP Address Auto-Creation on Import

All three import forms use a plain `forms.CharField` for `ip_address` backed by a `clean_ip_address()` method that calls `IPAddress.objects.get_or_create(address=raw)`. This means a CIDR string that does not yet exist in IPAM is silently created at import time rather than causing a validation error — the same behavior Proxmox endpoints have had since an earlier fix.

## Dependencies

- Inbound: `views/__init__.py` imports and re-exports these classes, and `urls.py` mounts them via `get_model_urls(...)`.
- Outbound: matching models, tables, filtersets, forms, and the `*_export.py` helpers in this directory.

## Notes

- The export JS (token version toggle, dropdown population, quick-add, copy-to-clipboard) is inlined as an IIFE in each `*endpoint_list.html` template rather than loaded as an external `.js` file. This avoids requiring `collectstatic` for the modal to work.
- The ProxmoxEndpoint detail page exposes **Sync Now** through `proxmox_sync_now.py`; it requires the shared Proxbox sync enqueue permission, uses a CSRF-protected POST, refuses disabled endpoints, and passes the viewed endpoint PK in `proxmox_endpoint_ids`.
- The ProxmoxEndpoint list/detail/dashboard status badge is a static gray `Disabled` badge when `enabled=False`; do not emit `data-service-status-url` for disabled Proxmox rows, otherwise the browser will poll keepalive and can repaint the inventory state as an error.
- The ProxmoxEndpoint list page exposes **Enable Selected** and **Disable Selected** through `ProxmoxEndpointBulkEnableView` / `ProxmoxEndpointBulkDisableView`. These are change-permission list actions that update only `enabled` with `queryset.update()`; do not switch them to per-object `save()` because the ProxmoxEndpoint `post_save` signal can register/sync endpoints with proxbox-api.
- Changes to list columns, validation, or field presentation typically happen outside this directory unless the view wiring itself changes.
- The complete endpoint allowlist, pending-state, and requirements-to-tests
  contract lives in
  [`docs/developer/endpoint-autoconfiguration.md`](../../../docs/developer/endpoint-autoconfiguration.md).
