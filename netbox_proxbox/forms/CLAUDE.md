This directory contains Django/NetBox forms for plugin models, plugin settings, and the filter forms used by list views.

## Files And Ownership

- [`__init__.py`](./__init__.py): re-exports all concrete form classes.
- [`proxmox.py`](./proxmox.py): create/edit and filter forms for
  `ProxmoxEndpoint`, including the Access control fieldset's broad
  `allow_writes` gate and separate default-off
  `allow_packer_template_builds` capability.
- [`netbox.py`](./netbox.py): create/edit and filter forms for `NetBoxEndpoint`, including local validation for token version selection.
- [`fastapi.py`](./fastapi.py): create/edit and filter forms for `FastAPIEndpoint`, including WebSocket and backend token fields.
- [`backup_routine.py`](./backup_routine.py): create/edit and filter forms for `BackupRoutine`.
- [`replication.py`](./replication.py): create/edit and filter forms for `Replication`.
- [`schedule_sync.py`](./schedule_sync.py): scheduling form for `ProxboxSyncJob` and quick-schedule defaults.
- [`ssh_credential.py`](./ssh_credential.py): per-node SSH credential create/edit
  and filter forms, including write-only password/private-key inputs and
  encryption-before-model-validation handling.
- [`settings.py`](./settings.py): plugin settings form
  (`ProxboxPluginSettings` singleton), write-only verified key-rotation form,
  and family-selective destructive-reset form with acknowledgement plus exact
  typed confirmation. Ordinary encryption controls are disabled while
  ciphertext exists.
- [`storage.py`](./storage.py): create/edit and filter forms for `ProxmoxStorage`.
- [`vm_backup.py`](./vm_backup.py): create/edit and filter forms for `VMBackup`.
- [`vm_snapshot.py`](./vm_snapshot.py): create/edit and filter forms for `VMSnapshot`.
- [`vm_task_history.py`](./vm_task_history.py): create/edit and filter forms for `VMTaskHistory`.
- [`widgets.py`](./widgets.py): custom widgets used by forms, including bootstrap checkbox styles.

## Dependencies

- Inbound: view classes in `views/` import these forms for object edit and list pages.
- Outbound: `netbox_proxbox.models`, `netbox_proxbox.choices`, NetBox form base classes, and NetBox core models such as `IPAddress`, `Token`, and `VirtualMachine`.

## Import Forms

Each endpoint type has an `ImportForm` (e.g. `ProxmoxEndpointImportForm`, `NetBoxEndpointImportForm`, `FastAPIEndpointImportForm`) that maps CSV/JSON column names to model fields:

- **`ip_address`** uses a plain `forms.CharField` backed by `clean_ip_address()`, which calls `IPAddress.objects.get_or_create(address=raw)`. Any CIDR string not already present in IPAM is silently created at import time. This avoids validation failures when moving data between NetBox instances.
- **`ProxmoxEndpointImportForm`** also uses `CSVChoiceField` for `mode`.
- **`NetBoxEndpointImportForm`** uses `CSVModelChoiceField` for `token` (looked up by key) and `CSVChoiceField` for `token_version`.

## Notes

- Secret edit forms never decrypt a stored value merely to decide whether a
  clear/replacement control should render. They use ciphertext presence and a
  secret-free `Recovery required` state; an undecryptable existing value must
  remain replaceable/clearable without a 500 or plaintext disclosure.
- `NetBoxEndpointForm.clean()` mirrors the API serializer's credential validation and clears unused token fields depending on token version.
- Endpoint forms use `DynamicModelChoiceField` for NetBox-managed related objects.
- Both FastAPI create/edit and import forms use
  `BackendKeyAdoptionFormMixin`. It forwards the virtual token property to the
  model's shared backend-key gate only when the form is actually saved, then
  converts a secret-safe model validation failure to NetBox's clean
  `AbortRequest` path. Merely validating or previewing an import never performs
  remote bootstrap side effects, and `save(commit=False)` remains network-free.
  The token field is an explicit candidate input: blank preserves an existing
  key. Creation, enablement, and configured target changes may leave it blank
  and enter bounded auto-configuration; a non-empty candidate remains required
  when the operator is deliberately rotating the key.
- These forms define how plugin fields are presented in the NetBox UI; model constraints and the API serializers still remain the source of truth for persistence and credential rules.
- `ProxmoxVMIntentForm` is the operator edit surface for desired VM state. It
  includes all thirteen operator inputs and excludes `intent_state` and
  `last_apply_run_id`; only the apply job writes those stamps. The form rejects
  changing an existing intent's parent VM because one intent row belongs to one
  guest for its whole lifetime.
- `ProxmoxMetricsInfluxDBForm` clears the edit-page initial value whenever a
  persisted InfluxDB URL fails the model's credential-free HTTPS display check.
  Its warning asks the operator to replace the hidden value or delete the mapping;
  never repopulate the input from the raw stored value. The query token is a
  write-only input encrypted with the plugin key; blank edit inputs preserve
  existing ciphertext.
- Password and token_value fields on `ProxmoxEndpointForm` use `PasswordInput(render_value=False)` and are preserved from the stored instance when the user submits a blank value (edit-without-change UX).
- `ProxmoxEndpointForm` exposes the broad `allow_writes` gate and the separate
  default-off `allow_packer_template_builds` capability in its **Access control**
  fieldset so operators make both trust assertions explicitly in the normal
  add/edit form.
- Endpoint-level browser-terminal SSH fields are shared between
  `ProxmoxEndpointForm` and `ProxmoxEndpointSSHSettingsForm` through
  `ProxmoxEndpointSSHCredentialFormMixin`. The selector
  `ssh_credential_source` chooses either dedicated encrypted SSH credentials or
  reuse of the endpoint username/password. Reuse mode requires an endpoint
  password plus a pinned SSH host-key fingerprint and ignores the dedicated
  SSH secret fields.
- `NodeSSHCredentialForm._post_clean()` encrypts submitted write-only secrets
  before model validation, then always delegates to
  `NetBoxModelForm._post_clean()`. That delegation is required even when no tags
  are selected: NetBox populates `instance._m2m_values` there and reads it
  unconditionally while saving M2M fields. Never copy Django's hook body into
  this form or any future form override.
- The private-key field uses `_WriteOnlyTextarea`: it inherits Textarea's normal
  multiline POST extraction and field cleaning, but its render formatter always
  returns `None`. Neither an initial key nor a submitted key is placed back into
  HTML after a validation error; the operator must re-enter it. Keep this paired
  with `PasswordInput(render_value=False)` for the password field.
