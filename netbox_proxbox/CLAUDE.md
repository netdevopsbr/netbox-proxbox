This package contains the NetBox plugin itself. It defines the plugin config, URL registration, navigation, models, forms, tables, API layer, background jobs, sync helpers, dashboard views, template hooks, and bundled static assets.

The service-monitoring scheduler evaluates eligibility and due/pending state
inside its per-endpoint failure boundary. An unavailable credential or readiness
error is recorded for that endpoint and must not skip subsequent healthy
endpoints. Required secret resolvers themselves must not return empty fallback
material to make scheduler or list-view callers succeed.

## Orphan VM purge page

`views/soft_deleted_vms.py` and its template provide the human-only cleanup
surface for Proxbox orphan records. The list and bulk-delete views share a
server-side filter requiring both the `proxbox-soft-deleted` tag and
`decommissioning` status. The bulk-delete view therefore cannot delete an
ordinary VM through either selected IDs or the `_all` path. Access requires
the core VirtualMachine delete permission, and the page never calls Proxmox.

## Files And Ownership

- [`__init__.py`](./__init__.py): plugin registration via `PluginConfig`, plugin metadata, and supported NetBox version range.
- [`urls.py`](./urls.py): plugin URL map for UI pages, model views, sync routes, keepalive checks, card hydration, and the WebSocket test endpoint.
- [`navigation.py`](./navigation.py): NetBox plugin menu groups and buttons. **Sync Jobs** targets `plugins:netbox_proxbox:job_list`, never `core:job_list` — the latter lists every job in the instance.
- [`choices.py`](./choices.py): `ChoiceSet` definitions for endpoint modes, sync types/statuses, token versions, and VM backup metadata.
- [`fields.py`](./fields.py): custom model/form field helpers used by the endpoint models.
- [`filtersets.py`](./filtersets.py): NetBox filtersets backing list views and API query filtering.
- [`jobs.py`](./jobs.py): `ProxboxSyncJob` background job class, enqueue helpers, and concurrent-run ownership guards.

> **The preflight blocks what provably cannot work, and hints at the rest.**
> `_ensure_backend_endpoints()` pushes the `NetBoxEndpoint` and `ProxmoxEndpoint`
> rows into proxbox-api before any stage runs. That NetBox push is what installs
> the credentials the backend writes NetBox objects with. **Six** conditions
> are fatal and raise `ProxboxPreflightError` immediately:
>
> 1. **No usable backend.** `get_fastapi_request_context()` returns nothing —
>    no enabled `FastAPIEndpoint`, or the selected one is unusable. Every stage
>    runs through that backend, so there is nothing left to try. The message
>    names the *selected* endpoint id when the job pinned one, and points at
>    Proxbox → Endpoints → FastAPI.
> 2. **No enabled `NetBoxEndpoint` in this NetBox.** Zero enabled rows is not a
>    failed push — it is this NetBox declining to be written to at all, i.e. the
>    documented disabled-endpoint no-connection gate. It blocks **unconditionally**,
>    and the backend's stored rows are deliberately **not** consulted:
>    `list_backend_netbox_endpoints()` is never even called. proxbox-api may still
>    hold credentials issued before the row was disabled, or credentials for an
>    entirely different NetBox instance; honouring either would let the sync keep
>    writing with exactly the authorization the operator revoked. Do **not**
>    "improve" this by falling back to the backend's own state when it happens to
>    hold a row — that is the bug this gate exists to close.
> 3. **Confirmed-empty backend.** The NetBox push failed **and** a follow-up
>    `list_backend_netbox_endpoints()` read confirms the backend holds **zero**
>    NetBox endpoints. Only reachable with at least one *enabled* local row, so
>    the backend's stored configuration is a legitimate fallback for a genuinely
>    *transient* push failure here — which is precisely why case 2 must return
>    before it.
> 4. **Stored rows that point at a *different* NetBox.** The push failed, the
>    backend does hold rows, but `backend_holds_netbox_endpoint()` cannot match
>    any of them to this instance. **Presence of a row proves nothing about whose
>    credentials it carries:** the backend NetBox endpoint is a *singleton* on
>    proxbox-api — `sync_netbox_endpoint_to_backend()` updates the first (and
>    only) entry by **position**, never by name — and unlike the Proxmox payload
>    (`"<name> (nb:<pk>)"`) the NetBox payload's `name` is free text with no
>    embedded pk. Identity is therefore the **resolved connection target**:
>    `(domain or ip_address)` plus `port` — literally what proxbox-api's own
>    `NetBoxEndpoint.url` property dials (`host = domain if domain else
>    ip_address`) — with `domain`/`ip_address` read from the *model* by
>    `_netbox_endpoint_identity()`. Both sides must resolve a target, and the two
>    targets must be equal.
>
>    **Compare the resolved target, not each field in turn.** Field-by-field
>    matching ("every field both sides declare must agree, and at least one must
>    positively match") was the earlier rule and it is wrong in *both* directions.
>    It **accepts** rows it should not: a stored row blank on `domain` at our IP
>    is a NetBox reached *by address*, a different service from ours reached by
>    vhost name at that same address — a blank stored field is data, not a gap.
>    The mirror case is a stored row naming *another* domain at our IP while we
>    are IP-only; that row dials their vhost. And it **rejects** rows it should
>    not: with a domain set the address is never dialled, so our own record whose
>    stored IP has since changed is still ours.
>
>    `port` is **required on both sides**, not "checked when present".
>    proxbox-api declares it non-optional on its `NetBoxEndpointResponse` and
>    `GET /endpoint` returns `list[NetBoxEndpointResponse]`, so every row this
>    backend produces carries one; a row without it is not from this backend, and
>    a port we cannot parse is a service we cannot identify. Same host, different
>    port is a different service.
>
>    **Do not read identity off `_netbox_endpoint_backend_payload()`** — that is
>    the push body, and it substitutes `"127.0.0.1"` when the row has no linked
>    IP so the backend still has something to dial. *Every* domain-only NetBox
>    therefore pushes the same loopback string, and matching on it let one
>    domain-only instance identify as another's stored record. Only an explicitly
>    configured IP is evidence; an absent one contributes nothing.
>
>    **Identity selects a candidate row; currency is what accepts it.** Proving a
>    stored row describes *this* NetBox does not prove it still describes this
>    NetBox *correctly*. The push body carries `verify_ssl` and `token_version`
>    alongside the target, so an operator who hardens TLS verification or rotates
>    the token scheme and then hits a transient push failure would otherwise
>    continue the run with proxbox-api writing under the **superseded** posture —
>    the same defect class as the stale-Proxmox-row case below.
>    `_netbox_row_is_current()` therefore also requires `verify_ssl` and
>    `token_version` to match, read from the **model** (not from
>    `_netbox_endpoint_backend_payload()`, which logs and materialises the secret
>    just to answer a comparison). An **absent** field reads as drifted: this
>    check gates the whole run, so unknown must fail closed here even though the
>    Proxmox-side twin can afford to treat an unknown as merely "push again".
>
>    The comparable set is bounded by what proxbox-api gives back.
>    `NetBoxEndpointResponse` returns `id, name, ip_address, domain, port,
>    token_version, verify_ssl, enabled` and deliberately withholds
>    `token`/`token_key`, so the *secret* cannot be compared against the stored
>    row at all — it is checked separately, and **locally**, by case 6 below.
>    `name` **is** returned and is deliberately **not** compared: it is free
>    text, and a rename is not a reason to hard-fail an otherwise safe run.
>
>    **The listing must hold exactly one row.** proxbox-api's NetBox endpoint is
>    a *positional* singleton — the push overwrites entry `[0]`, and entry `[0]`
>    is what the backend dials — so a listing returning **more than one** row
>    means the contract this check rests on no longer describes the backend, and
>    nothing in the response says which row wins. Matching anywhere in the list
>    would then vouch for a row found at index 1 while a stale record at index 0,
>    possibly another NetBox's, is the one actually driving the sync — the same
>    cross-instance write this check exists to stop, reached by counting rows
>    instead of by reading the wrong one. More than one row is therefore refused
>    outright, whatever those rows say. With exactly one row the loop is asking
>    identity and currency of the row that actually matters, so a current row
>    belonging to a *different* NetBox never rescues our own drifted one.
>
>    A match means a *transient refresh* failure over still-ours (possibly stale)
>    credentials → warn and continue. No match means proxbox-api holds another
>    NetBox's credentials, or our own under a configuration we have since
>    replaced, and continuing would sync this estate's Proxmox data **into someone
>    else's NetBox** or under revoked trust settings. The check is fail-closed at
>    every step (empty/`None` list, a list longer than the positional singleton,
>    row with neither host field, conflicting field, unparseable port, missing
>    currency field → *not held*).
> 5. **Nothing pushed and nothing readable.** The NetBox push failed for *every*
>    enabled row **and** `list_backend_netbox_endpoints()` itself failed, so
>    there is no evidence at all that the backend's credentials belong to this
>    NetBox — only that it may hold somebody's. This is the one place "unknown"
>    must not read as "ours": the branch is reachable only after a failed push,
>    and continuing would reintroduce exactly the cross-instance write case 4
>    blocks, just through an ambiguous read instead of a mismatched row. The
>    exception is a run where *some* enabled row pushed successfully — that push
>    wrote this NetBox's credentials into the singleton, so the unreadable
>    listing has nothing left to add and the run continues with a warning.
> 6. **A stored row that is ours, but was written with credentials we have since
>    replaced.** The push failed, a stored row *does* pass case 4's identity and
>    currency checks — and the API token behind it has been rotated in place
>    since the last successful push. "This row describes this NetBox" and "this
>    row carries the credential this NetBox currently issues" are different
>    questions, and case 4 can only answer the first: the response model withholds
>    `token`/`token_key`, so there is nothing on the wire to compare a secret
>    against. Continuing would let proxbox-api keep writing with the token the
>    operator has just revoked — and the entire point of rotating is that the old
>    value stops working.
>
>    The comparison is therefore **local**: every successful push records
>    `netbox_credential_fingerprint(payload)` — a keyed HMAC-SHA256 over
>    `token_version`, `token_key` and `token` — on
>    `NetBoxEndpoint.pushed_credential_fingerprint` (migration 0073), and
>    `netbox_push_credentials_unchanged()` re-derives it from the endpoint as it
>    stands now and compares with `hmac.compare_digest`. It is not a credential:
>    `salted_hmac` keys off NetBox's `SECRET_KEY`, so the digest is
>    non-reversible and is not even comparable across installs. An **empty**
>    stored fingerprint reads as *changed* — never pushed, or a first run after
>    upgrading into this check — which is the fail-closed reading, and one
>    successful push clears it permanently. The three-way is
>    `vouched` → warn and continue, `held` but not vouched → **fatal (this
>    case)**, neither → **fatal (case 4)**; see
>    [`views/CLAUDE.md`](./views/CLAUDE.md) for why the fingerprint is taken from
>    the *payload* and written with `queryset.update()`.
>
> Two review-raised escalations are **deliberately not taken**, and the
> rationale is part of the contract. *(1) Credential receipts are install-global,
> not per-backend.* With two enabled `FastAPIEndpoint` rows, a successful push
> to backend B records the fingerprint that would then vouch for backend A's
> stored row. That is a real bound — accepted because `FastAPIEndpoint` is
> singleton-shaped by product contract (multiple enabled rows are already an
> unsupported configuration the docs warn about), and keying receipts per
> backend means a receipt *table*, not a column. Revisit only if multi-backend
> ever becomes supported. *(2) A failed Proxmox push over rotated credentials
> warns; it does not gate.* The reviewer's overlap-rotation scenario (old token
> still valid with broader permissions) is real but self-limiting: the backend
> keeps reading the same, target-verified Proxmox with a credential the operator
> has not yet revoked, and the moment it is revoked the failure is loud. Gating
> would convert every transient push failure after a rotation into a blocked
> sync — the NetBox side gates because *its* staleness writes into the wrong
> instance silently; the Proxmox side's staleness is an authorization-intent
> drift that the preflight now **names** in the warning and hint instead.
>
> Every other preflight problem — a failed key registration, a failed *Proxmox*
> push, or a listing call that errored *after* a successful NetBox push — stays
> non-fatal and is returned on `PreflightResult.hint`, which
> `sync_stages.py` appends to any later stage error. Do not widen the
> confirmed-empty case: a run that could have worked must never be blocked on an
> ambiguous read *about which endpoints exist*. Do not narrow it either — before this existed, a fresh install
> with no backend credentials burned ~83 s of retries and then reported `Error
> ensuring Proxbox tag` on the `devices` stage, sending operators to debug tags

> **The selected-object batch path runs the same preflight.** A "sync selected
> objects" run (`batch_object_type` + `batch_object_ids`) reaches proxbox-api

> **…and it resolves the same *Proxmox* scope, for a sharper reason.** The

> `sync_individual()`, for the same `_CONTEXT_KEYS` reason the branch schema id
> travels that way (see [`services/CLAUDE.md`](./services/CLAUDE.md)).
>
> **A partial resolution narrows the scope; it does not fail the run.**
> `_batch_wire_endpoint_scope()` returns `(scope, skipped_plugin_pks, error,
> wire_id_by_plugin_pk)`, and unresolved endpoints are reported in
> `skipped_plugin_pks` and logged as a `warning` naming them, not raised. Failing
> outright because one *unrelated* endpoint drifted would be a regression, and the
> narrowed scope is still strictly safer than the unscoped request it replaces.
>
> **But a narrowed job-wide scope is not by itself enough, and the earlier note
> here claiming an object on a skipped endpoint "fails loudly at the backend" was
> wrong.** It only fails loudly when *no other in-scope endpoint can answer* — and
> Proxmox identifiers are unique **per endpoint**, not across the estate. A
> selected-object request names a cluster, a node and a VMID and nothing else, so
> two unrelated Proxmox installations each holding a `cluster01/pve1/100` both

> `_run_batch_selected_sync()` resolves each object's owner through
> `ProxmoxCluster.netbox_cluster` / `ProxmoxCluster.endpoint` (one grouped query
> for the whole batch, beside the object fetch — not one per object in front of a
> per-object HTTP call) and then:
>
> - **owner resolved and in the map** → the call is pinned to that *single* wire

>   skipped) → that object alone fails with HTTP **424** and a message naming the
>   endpoint id, because asking the *remaining* endpoints is exactly the
>   duplicate-identifier case above;
> - **owner claimed by more than one endpoint** → that object alone fails with
>   HTTP **424** naming every claimant. Two endpoints reflecting the same core
>   cluster is *proof* the duplicate-identifier namespace exists in this estate,
>   so widening to the job-wide scope would ask both and keep whichever answered
>   — precisely the failure being fixed — while picking one arbitrarily would be
>   a *guess* about where the object lives;
> - **owner not resolvable at all** — no cluster, or nothing has reflected a
>   `ProxmoxCluster` for it yet → fall back to the job-wide scope, but **only
>   while that scope names a single endpoint**. A first-ever sync is precisely the
>   run with nothing to resolve an owner from, and refusing there would make the
>   object unsyncable forever — but that argument only pays for itself where
>   widening is free. With one endpoint in scope, "the job-wide scope" and "that
>   one endpoint" are the same request, so the fallback is already pinned and no
>   duplicate-identifier hazard exists. With **two or more** in scope it is a
>   guess, made with identifiers (cluster/node/VMID) that are unique only *per*
>   endpoint, so the wrong estate can answer and its data lands in this row with
>   no error raised — the exact defect this whole section removes, reached by the
>   one branch that still widened. So a multi-endpoint run refuses that object
>   with HTTP **424** instead, saying how many endpoints are in scope and how to
>   proceed. Refusing is recoverable and widening is not: a staged sync reflects
>   the clusters, ownership becomes resolvable, and the retry pins — whereas the
>   wrong data, once written, is already in NetBox. `job_scope_wire_ids` is
>   counted **once** per batch, not re-split per object. **Unknown and ambiguous

- [`template_content.py`](./template_content.py): plugin template extensions for Job, VirtualMachine, and reflected-resource buttons/panels. Sync Now buttons resolve the target model's registered `proxbox_sync_now` action with NetBox `get_viewname()` plus Django `reverse()`; core Cluster/Device pages target their linked plugin tracking row, while plugin storage/backup/snapshot/task rows and core VMs target themselves. `ProxboxVirtualMachineTemplateExtension.buttons()` also composes the browser-console handoff after its other VM actions. `console_button()` requires the sync permission, a runtime-revalidated HTTPS `console_url`, a saved VM, and authoritative typed sync state with a positive VMID and `qemu`/`lxc` type; it links only to the NMS guest detail route using the NetBox VM primary key and does not append `?tab=console`. See `../docs/features/browser-console.md`. `ProxboxJobTemplateExtension.buttons()` also renders a **Bug report** button on core Job detail pages for Proxbox sync jobs that ended in an error/unknown state (see `bug_report.py`); the Proxbox-only jobs list links to that page rather than repeating the modal per row.
- [`bug_report.py`](./bug_report.py): pure, read-only helper that assembles the failed-job **Bug report** modal context — plugin/NetBox versions, job metadata, formatted `log_entries`, a copy-to-clipboard `report_text`, and a prefilled netbox-proxbox GitHub *new issue* URL. Gated by `is_reportable_status(status)` (errored/failed or any unknown status). Every string it emits is scrubbed by a **single** `anonymize.Anonymizer`, and `report_text` plus the issue URL are composed from the already-scrubbed parts — see the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §"Bug-report anonymization" for why the URL is the invariant that matters.
- [`redaction.py`](./redaction.py): the shared, dependency-free vocabulary of credential-bearing field markers and HTTP authentication schemes, imported by **both** `anonymize.py` (public report) and `views/error_utils.py` (job log). It also owns `redact_assignments()`, the single-pass scanner both use: it captures a whole candidate field name and asks `is_sensitive_key` about it rather than searching for a marker inside the key, which removes the second spelling of the vocabulary, every length cap, and a quadratic scan in one move. **Must import nothing but `re`** — `anonymize` needs it without Django, and `error_utils` sits behind a package that requires Django.
- [`anonymize.py`](./anonymize.py): pure `re` + stdlib scrubber for that payload. Replaces credentials, URLs, e-mails, realm principals, colon/hyphen/Cisco-dotted MACs, IPv4/IPv6, and allowlisted-suffix FQDNs with **stable** per-instance placeholders (`<host-1>`, `<ip-2>`) so a report stays correlatable without naming the estate. MAC separators are normalized for placeholder identity. Complete UUID protection plus identifier-safe bare/labeled MAC branches avoid corrupting longer hyphen-, dot-, or colon-delimited diagnostic identifiers; explicit hardware-address labels keep compact `hwaddr:`/`macaddr:` fields redacted. Broader IPv6/FQDN matching runs first to prevent partial disclosure. **Must never import Django** — `tests/test_bug_report.py` exec-loads its consumer without one. Takes its credential vocabulary from `redaction.py`.

- [`websocket_client.py`](./websocket_client.py): long-lived WebSocket client, message queue, and HTTP view used to stream backend messages into NetBox pages. The view resolves only enabled FastAPI rows and returns before URL/header construction for disabled inventory.
- [`signals.py`](./signals.py): Django signal handlers that authenticate an
  already-persisted FastAPIEndpoint key before downstream endpoint delivery.
  ProxmoxEndpoint delivery is registered with `transaction.on_commit()` and
  re-reads the committed row before any backend access, so an outer API
  transaction rollback cannot leak a grant. Each successful push records the
  effective Packer grant in the internal
  `packer_template_builds_backend_authorized` field without re-entering
  `post_save`; failed revocation preserves the previous true value and keeps
  deletion blocked.
  A disabled ProxmoxEndpoint save is the one disabled-row exception: the
  receiver may use that trusted backend context only for a credential-free
  policy update on an existing proxbox-api row, setting `enabled=False` and
  `allow_packer_template_builds=False`; it never creates the row or pushes
  Proxmox credentials.
  Explicit-candidate adoption belongs to `FastAPIEndpoint.save()`; that model
  schedules pending rows through `transaction.on_commit` into bounded
  `services.endpoint_autoconfiguration`, which treats the exact
  UI-persisted target as its allowlist and may generate/persist a key only for a
  confirmed first-key bootstrap.
  Every boundary that reads plugin ciphertext catches the
  `utils.encryption.EncryptionError` hierarchy, logs only identifiers and a
  fixed recovery state, and skips downstream synchronization.

## Data Flow

- Endpoint objects are created in NetBox through forms and model views.
- List and detail pages are rendered by classes in `views/` using tables, filtersets, and templates.
- Sync routes call the external ProxBox FastAPI backend using the configured `FastAPIEndpoint`. Two sync transport modes are available:
  - POST polling (traditional): the plugin waits for completion and returns a single JSON response.
  - GET SSE streaming: the plugin proxies `text/event-stream` from the FastAPI backend to the browser via `StreamingHttpResponse`. The browser JS parses SSE frames and renders granular per-object progress in real time.
- The API layer exposes the same main models through NetBox plugin API endpoints.
- The plugin contains a read-only version 1 semantic-tool producer manifest for
  a future compatible SDK. No released SDK identity is currently activated; the
  API root omits `mcp` and `/api/plugins/proxbox/mcp/` returns 503. The producer
  manifest describes `list_sync_jobs` and
  `schedule_sync`, which reuse the existing `sync/schedule/` view and its
  `core.add_job` check. Proxbox does not host FastMCP or a parallel credential;
  once immutably activated, netbox-sdk owns discovery, validation, the generic
  `plugin_list_tools` / `plugin_call_tool` MCP surface, and server-wide mutation
  gating.
  Explicit Proxmox endpoint scopes are fail-closed: any unknown or disabled ID
  rejects the entire request before enqueue, while an omitted scope retains the
  intentional all-enabled behavior. The target serializer also enforces the
  manifest's strict `additionalProperties: false`, exact concrete
  `sync_stages`, unique list items, positive signed-64-bit endpoint IDs with
  full-range integer literals but float/Decimal normalization only through
  `9007199254740991`, nonempty explicit Proxmox scopes, no MCP
  NetBox-endpoint scope, representable strict RFC 3339 timestamps,
  exactly-one-unit bounded recurrence, and 200-character job-name limit.
  Ambiguous schedule outcomes are never auto-retried. Named JSON examples in
  `docs/api/semantic-mcp-bridge.md` are executable test contracts rather than
  illustrative text that may drift.
  Bridge schema version 1 is the generic descriptor protocol, not a frozen
  Proxbox payload. Stage selection controls the 13 SSE stages only: endpoint
  preflight and scoped cluster/node, firewall, datacenter, and normally
  VM-template reconciliation still run. Only the exact unique full stage set
  becomes internal `[all]`, preserving recurring hints and repair debounce.
  Keep `tests/fixtures/netbox_sdk_bridge_activation.json` blocked until an exact
  SDK version and its clean full-commit package blobs, fixed module origin,
  explicit CI provisioning, safe integer behavior, and normalized-UTC
  month-boundary RFC 3339 leap behavior all pass together.
- Browser-side pages use templates plus JS from `static/netbox_proxbox/js/` for dashboard hydration, keepalive polling, SSE streaming, log rendering, and WebSocket updates.
- Operator recovery for missing Proxbox bootstrap/custom-field setup is exposed
  through `views/sync_state_repair.py` and the shared
  `partials/bootstrap_status_card.html`. The card lives on its own page at
  `sync-state/` (`views/sync_state_repair_page.py::SyncStateRepairPageView`, template
  `templates/netbox_proxbox/sync_state_repair.html`), which is **deliberately
  not registered in `navigation.py`**: its only entry point is the
  **Repair / Rebuild sync-state** link in the Home page footer. The page
  includes the card with `proxbox_repair_page=True` so it is always visible
  there. Its inline JS still auto-checks `sync-state/bootstrap-status/` on load
  (only when the user has `view_fastapiendpoint`) and flags a genuine
  backend-reported problem (`ok:false` with `http_status == 200`, e.g. the
  "Invalid v1 token" warnings); a healthy backend, an unreachable/unconfigured
  backend (no FastAPI endpoint → 404), or a transport failure is not a
  needs-attention state. **Repair-only users** (`core.add_job` without
  `view_fastapiendpoint`) keep the repair affordance with no bootstrap payload
  exposed. Included on any other page the card reverts to its hidden-until-needed
  behaviour via the nested `{% if not proxbox_repair_page %}{% if
  bootstrap_status.can_view or not can_repair_sync_state %} d-none{% endif %}
  {% endif %}` guard.
- The `sync-state/repair/` POST (`core.add_job`) calls
  `POST /extras/custom-fields/reconcile` through `services/backend_proxy.py` and
  then enqueues a normal full `ProxboxSyncJob`. **The custom-field reconcile is a
  best-effort first step, not a gate:** when proxbox-api holds a stale/invalid
  NetBox credential (the "Invalid v1 token" state), the reconcile POST
  authenticates with that same broken credential and fails — but aborting there
  would skip the only recovery path, because the queued sync's preflight
  (`jobs.py::_ensure_backend_endpoints`) re-pushes the `NetBoxEndpoint` (and
  `ProxmoxEndpoint`) credentials to proxbox-api and the sync rebuilds the typed
  `Proxbox*SyncState` sidecars from live Proxmox data. So a reconcile failure is
  recorded on `SyncStateRepairOutcome.reconcile_warning` and the rebuild sync is
  **still queued**; the view surfaces it as a `messages.warning` (still linking
  the job) instead of `messages.success`. Only `permission_denied`,
  `already_running` (active-job debounce), and `enqueue_error` (the sync could
  not be queued) are hard failures. Both backend calls resolve the FastAPI
  endpoint through a request-user-restricted queryset before passing the endpoint
  ID to the backend proxy. It must remain a UI/session action with flash-message
  error handling that never returns a 500, not a new sync transport.

## Import / Export

All three endpoint types support CSV, JSON, and YAML export via dedicated `ExportView` classes in `views/endpoints/`. Export comes in two modes:

- **Safe export** (no credentials): available to any user with `view` permission.
- **Sensitive export** (includes credentials): requires the user to supply a valid NetBox API token (v1 or v2) via the export-secrets modal. The token is validated server-side before the download is served.

Import uses NetBox's `BulkImportView`. All import forms auto-create missing `IPAddress` objects via `get_or_create` so data can move between NetBox instances without manual IPAM pre-population. Exported `id` columns are stripped before processing to prevent PK collisions.

**NetBoxEndpoint and FastAPIEndpoint are singleton-shaped.** If a record already exists when a bulk import is submitted, the import view intercepts the request and renders a confirmation page (`singleton_import_confirm.html`) before deleting the existing record and creating the replacement. Operational helpers use the first enabled FastAPI endpoint; disabled endpoints are inventory-only and must not trigger backend registration or HTTP probes. ProxmoxEndpoint allows multiple rows and has no singleton constraint.

Automatic endpoint discovery is configuration-bound. Once a FastAPI endpoint
row exists, only its exact persisted URL/IP, port, and TLS policy may be probed
or receive a stored key. Without a row, candidates come only from
`PLUGINS_CONFIG` or same-site names derived from NetBox's trusted public origin.
Never add network scans, redirect following, or a caller-supplied discovery URL.

FastAPI target construction is a security boundary. Adoption accepts only a
validated DNS name or IP address, canonicalizes case/address text, brackets IPv6
literals, and rejects URL userinfo, paths, queries, fragments, or malformed
authorities before a candidate key can enter any request.

Successful adoption persists a credential-free
`backend_key_target_fingerprint` covering the canonical primary HTTP target,
fallback IP, port, TLS flags, and WebSocket target flags. Runtime HTTP and
WebSocket callers recompute it with a fresh IP FK before exposing the key and
fail closed on drift. The long-lived WebSocket client also checks trust after
the handshake, on a time-based cadence during busy streams, and before queued
sends; it disables ambient proxies, refuses redirects before sending the key,
and is cancelled on endpoint saves so stale credentials cannot outlive a
configuration change.

For detailed implementation notes see [`views/endpoints/CLAUDE.md`](./views/endpoints/CLAUDE.md) and [`forms/CLAUDE.md`](./forms/CLAUDE.md).

## Dependencies

- Inbound: NetBox plugin loader imports `config`, NetBox route registration imports `urls.py`, and the menu system imports `navigation.py`.
- Outbound: Django/NetBox APIs, `requests`, `websockets`, the external ProxBox FastAPI service, GitHub raw content for the contributing page, and standard NetBox core models like `users.Token`, `ipam.IPAddress`, `virtualization.VirtualMachine`, and `virtualization.Cluster`.

## Optional netbox-rpc companion card (home dashboard)

The home dashboard renders an optional **netbox-rpc** companion card when that
plugin is installed. `integrations/rpc.py::rpc_dashboard_context()` is a soft,
best-effort helper (never imports `netbox_rpc` at module load; `try/except
ImportError`; never issues a network call) that returns
`{"rpc_integration": {installed, enabled, backend_name, backend_url, home_url,
settings_supported}}` — or `{}` when netbox-rpc is absent, so the card is simply
omitted. It reads `netbox_rpc.RpcPluginSettings.get_solo()` for the opt-in
`enabled` flag and configured backend when present, and degrades cleanly against
an older netbox-rpc that predates that model. `views/home_context.py`
(`_build_rpc_integration_context`) wires it into `build_home_dashboard_context`,
and `templates/netbox_proxbox/home.html` renders the card (config state +
"Configure & opt in" link to `/plugins/rpc/`). Live backend reachability is left
to the netbox-rpc landing page's own *Test connection* action, so the Proxbox
dashboard render stays fast. Guarded by `tests/test_rpc_integration.py`.

## Per-endpoint netbox-rpc enablement (optional companion)

`ProxmoxEndpoint.rpc_enabled` is a **tri-state** (`BooleanField(null=True)`)
per-endpoint override for netbox-rpc operations against that endpoint, mirroring
the `overwrite_*` pattern. `ProxmoxEndpoint.effective_rpc_enabled()` resolves it:
netbox-rpc installation is a precondition for all paths; after the
**function-local, guarded** `try/except ImportError` import succeeds, the
per-endpoint value wins when set (`is not None`, so an explicit `False` is
respected); otherwise it **inherits the global** netbox-rpc opt-in flag
(`netbox_rpc.RpcPluginSettings.enabled`). This is the allowed **optional**
proxbox→rpc integration; the model never imports netbox-rpc at load time and
**must never depend on the NMS stack**.

The field is editable on the endpoint **Settings tab** (new **RPC** pane,
`NullBooleanSelect`, `RPC_FIELD_GROUPS` in `constants.py`) and exposed over REST
(`ProxmoxEndpointSerializer.rpc_enabled` writable + read-only
`effective_rpc_enabled` `SerializerMethodField`) so external callers can read the
resolved value. Added by migration `0059_proxmoxendpoint_rpc_enabled`
(`add_field_idempotent`). Contract-tested in `tests/test_rpc_endpoint_override.py`
and `tests/test_frontend_contracts.py` (5-pane Settings tab).

**Non-enforcing here:** resolution + UI only. The fail-closed *gate* (block RPC
against a disabled endpoint) lives in the layer allowed to read the endpoint —
netbox-proxbox for RPC it initiates, and the NMS layer (nms-backend) for
dispatch — and ships separately once operators have enabled RPC.

## Configuration

`ProxboxPluginSettings` (see [`models/plugin_settings.py`](./models/plugin_settings.py))
is the singleton that holds runtime tunables for both this plugin and the companion
`proxbox-api` backend. **New runtime tunables belong here, not in proxbox-api's
`.env`** — the backend reads them through `proxbox_api.runtime_settings.get_*` which
resolves env > plugin settings > default with a 5-minute cache. See
[top-level `CLAUDE.md` → Plugin settings and configuration](../CLAUDE.md) for the full
policy and the short list of `.env`-only operator infrastructure variables.

Ceph write timing uses the same cross-service contract through
`ceph_task_timeout`, `ceph_task_poll_interval`, and
`ceph_run_lease_seconds` (migration 0077). The model, form, settings serializer,
settings view/template, and operator docs must retain identical defaults and
bounds, including polling interval <= task timeout. proxbox-api snapshots the
three values once per adapter request, normalizes environment-derived polling,
renews the lease independently from provider work, and persists the selected
lease duration on the operation run.

Plugin-at-rest key recovery is owned by
`services/encryption_recovery.py`, the settings forms/views, and the
`0081_encrypted_secret_reset_permission` migration (developed in parallel with
the #295/#297 sibling migrations as a colliding 0079 and renumbered to 0081 at
merge time). Its central registry is
exhaustive across all plugin `*_enc` model fields and conditionally includes
netbox-pbs `PBSPluginSettings.proxbox_api_key_enc` when that Django app is
installed. Only genuine app absence is skipped; installed-but-unresolved
models or tables fail closed. Ordinary serializers never expose the plugin
key. The backend-only runtime action temporarily retains its existing
superuser/settings-change permission gate because current proxbox-api releases
still use it as their final at-rest-key fallback; remove that path only with a
paired backend migration. Prefer independent plugin-at-rest,
backend-at-rest, and FastAPI request-authentication keys.

Tenant assignment for Proxmox-synced NetBox `VirtualMachine` rows is plugin-side
post-sync behavior. Regex assignment is controlled by
`enable_tenant_name_regex` plus `tenant_name_regex_rules`; tag assignment is
controlled by `enable_tenant_tag_assignment`. The tag resolver requires both a
`cloud-customer` marker tag and exactly one `tenant-<slug>` tag, never overwrites
an existing VM tenant, and auto-creates missing `Tenant` rows under the
`cloud-customers` `TenantGroup`. Cluster inheritance is controlled by
`enable_tenant_from_cluster`; when enabled it runs after regex and tag assignment
and fills an empty VM tenant from `vm.cluster.tenant`, so explicit name/tag rules
win and existing VM tenants are never overwritten. Per-`ProxmoxEndpoint`
overrides inherit from the global plugin settings when left null.

Cloud-customer network discovery is also settings-backed. The plugin stores the
operator-designated IPAM Prefix ID, bridge, VLAN tag, gateway, and lock flag on
`ProxboxPluginSettings`; proxbox-api and nms-backend must resolve those fields
instead of hardcoding estate network values. Populate them with the idempotent
`python manage.py ensure_cloud_customer_network --prefix ... --vlan ... --gateway ... [--enable-lock]`
command.
